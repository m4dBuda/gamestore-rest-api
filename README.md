## Structure and Installation

This API is defined as a restAPI that provides HTTP requests to a server, that handles JSON data and communicates directly to a database.

The data validation is done using `Validator` from NodeJS.
The tests are done using `Jest` and `Supertest`
The connection to the database and models are done using `Sequelize` and `Mysql2`
The password cryptographies, checkings and permissions are done using `Bcrypt` and `JsonWebToken`
The time-date data is translated using `Moment`

This API uses the following frameworks and libraries:

`Express`, `Sequelize`, `Jest`, `Supertest`, `Bcrypt`, `Moment`, `Morgan`, `Mysql2`, `Nodemon`, `Http`, `Validator`, `Axios`, `JWT`.

The database was created using `MySQL`.

You can try installing with `npm install`, but if it doesn't work you can try running the npm install command declaring the framework name, example: `npm i sequelize`

## Usage
This API was made for a Video-game Shop made in React.js, you can use it
to manage users, logins and password change, and also to store products,
put them into a cart, show the card with the products and related things.
Theres also a table for user privileges in the application, that you can explore and use.

The application database is on the `db_first_store` folder, you can import the .sql file to your database and name it as you want, just remember to also update your config.json file.
